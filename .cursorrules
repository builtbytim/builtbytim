1. This is my portfolio site as a full software engineer that specilaizes in web, AI and blockchain apps.
2. Here a small info about me . Timileyin (goes by Tim) is a full-stack developer and product-minded engineer based in Nigeria. His current focus is building clean, self-contained web microproducts that showcase his skills publicly and attract remote opportunities organically — without relying on freelancing platforms.

He works primarily with Python and JavaScript, building both frontend and backend systems from scratch. He prefers writing his own authentication, backend logic, and APIs, and thinks in terms of architecture and long-term maintainability.

Tim builds tools that are useful, focused, and developer-friendly. Most of his projects are solo-built — from database design and backend systems to frontend UX and deployment.

He believes in working in public, shipping fast, and building systems that don’t break. His projects are designed to be composable, reusable, and shareable.

His long-term goal is to turn his portfolio of products into sustainable leverage — whether that’s income, open-source traction, or remote work opportunities that find him through what he builds.
